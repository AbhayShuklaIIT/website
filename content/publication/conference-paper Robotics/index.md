abstract: Automation in farming processes is a growing field of research in both academia and industries. A considerable amount of work has been put into this field to develop systems robust enough for farming. Terrace farming, in particular, provides a varying set of challenges, including reliable step climbing methods and stable navigation in unstructured terrains. We propose the design of a novel autonomous terrace farming robot, 'Aarohi’, that can effectively climb steep terraces of considerable heights. The design optimisation strategy for the overall mechanical structure is elucidated. Further, the embedded and software architecture are presented for a working prototype. The navigation strategy for autonomous traversal over the terrace steps using the scissor lift mechanism has also been discussed along with the experimental results for the controller. The adaptability of the design to specific operational requirements and modular farm tools allow 'Aarohi’ to be customised for a wide variety of use cases.
